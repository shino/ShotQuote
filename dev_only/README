README for dev_only directory
  2009/11/30  created by Shun'ichi Shinohara

I place files used in a development process are placed in this
directory.

In order to keep a release apk file small, I want to exclude these
files in the apk file. When building by 1.6 SDK, this directory is NOT
included properly. However I don't know this rule is accidental or
not. If there is more standard and/or suitable directory name for such
files, this directory's name should be renamed.
